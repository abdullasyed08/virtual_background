Real-Time Virtual Background üèûÔ∏è
This project uses Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to create a real-time virtual background effect. The script processes a live webcam feed, uses AI-powered selfie segmentation to distinguish a person from their background, and replaces the background with a custom image.

## Key Features
Real-Time Performance: Applies the virtual background with minimal latency.

AI-Powered: Utilizes Google's MediaPipe for robust and accurate human segmentation without needing a physical green screen.

Custom Backgrounds: Supports both JPG and PNG image files as virtual backgrounds.

Edge Smoothing: Includes an advanced mode with mask blurring to create a "feathered" edge for a more natural blend between the foreground and background.

## Technologies Used
